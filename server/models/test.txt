Case study is a research technique based on the assumption that proper education should be based on building the ability to deal with real-life situations. The main goal is to provide the students with the detailed description of the particular situation in business, economics or social life for the subsequent analysis. Case studies are primarily used in marketing or business training, however, with the growing popularity of this method the application fields expand either, for example, technological or medical disciplines had also been studied by the close examination of the cases related to these areas. Before starting to analyse the particular case it is inevitable to understand whether the students caught the main ideas of it or not. For this aim, quizzes containing different questions about the content of the case are used. As it was said earlier, creating the questionnaires based on any type of the text is quite a complicated task itself, however, it gets even more complicated because of the specificity of the case studies. For effective teaching only new relevant cases should be used, so professors have to analyse reappearing cases quite often, in order to select suitable one and create the questions checking the understanding of its content. Developing the instrument which will generate the questions to the particular chosen pieces of the texts may help professors and teachers to simplify and speed up the process.
